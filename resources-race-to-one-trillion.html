                      <p>Bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply since hitting all-time highs late last year.</p>
                      
                      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=billybambrough&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=cryptocodex&sh=4c470317dec8">Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and successfully navigate the crypto price roller coaster</a></p>
                        
                      <p>The bitcoin price twice surged to over $60,000 per bitcoin last year giving the bitcoin network a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. The current bitcoin price of just over $40,000 gives it a market cap of almost $800 billion. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, reached a peak market cap of just over $500 billion in November last year.</p>
                        
                      <p>Now, crypto market price research has revealed when bitcoin, ethereum, BNB, XRP, cardano and other major cryptocurrencies could hit the $1 trillion mark if they continue to grow at their average annual growth rate.</p>
                        
                        <div class="img-block">
                            <img src="img/article-2.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                          Bitcoin, with an average annual growth rate of 159%, could return to the trillion-dollar mark as soon as early 2023, according to research from digital asset industry review and analysis website Crypto Head—which excluded any coin created after January 1 2019, including the fast-growing, top ten coin solana. Ethereum, with an average annual growth rate of 308%, is also projected to become a trillion-dollar asset around the same time.
                        </p>


                        <!-- <div class="video-block">

                        </div> -->

                        <p>Ethereum rivals BNB and cardano, with average annual growth rates of 615% and 423% respectively, are forecast to hit a $1 trillion dollar market cap by in 2024.</p>

                        <p>
                          Further down the charts, Ripple's XRP, currently the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, has an average annual growth rate of 88%, putting it at the $1 trillion level by the end of 2028. The cryptocurrency with the highest average annual growth rate is fantom at just over 5,000%, with a market cap of $9 million in 2019, its on track to hit the trillion-dollar mark in 2024.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Among crypto companies, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Holdings could be the first crypto company to hit the trillion-dollar mark, predicted to reach it in 2026, based on an annual growth rate of 488%.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Jack Dorsey's Block, formerly Square, could be close behind, potentially hitting the trillion-dollar level in 2029. Companies with no public market capitalization prior to the beginning of 2019, including Binance and Coinbase, were excluded from the research.
                        </p>

                        <p>Despite historic growth rates suggesting many major cryptocurrencies could hit fresh all-time highs in coming years, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/04/16/critical-juncture-shock-crypto-price-prediction-revealed-as-bitcoin-and-ethereum-brace-for-volatility/?sh=737999de3801" target="_blank">crypto market watchers are uncertain about the short-term outlook</a>.</p>

                        <p>"Bitcoin sold off hard during the last quarter of 2021, but then during the first frame of 2022, it underwent a period of relatively directionless trading," Paul Robinson, strategist at DailyFX, said in emailed comments, adding, "typically, once bitcoin gets rolling it doesn’t take long to muster a fresh level of market interest."</p>
                        <p>The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last few months, moving in line with equity markets, as traders come to terms with the Federal Reserve's increasingly hawkish stance and weigh the economic cost of Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
                        <p>"Contracting price action over the last three months could continue to make things even choppier in the near term, but given the nature of volatility and the fact that this is bitcoin, volatility is likely to ramp up again as we head towards the middle of the year," said Robinson.</p>

                Carefully consider each Product’s investment objectives, risk factors, fees and expenses before investing.
                This and other information can be found in each Product’s private placement memorandum, which may be
                obtained from LPC and, for each Product that is an SEC reporting company, the SEC’s website. Read these
                documents carefully before investing.

                Investments in the Products are speculative investments that involve high degrees of risk, including a
                partial or total loss of invested funds. LPC Products are not suitable for any investor that cannot afford
                loss of the entire investment. The shares of each Product are intended to reflect the price of the digital
                asset(s) held by such Product (based on digital asset(s) per share), less such Product’s expenses and other
                liabilities. Because each Product does not currently operate a redemption program, there can be no assurance
                that the value of such Product’s shares will reflect the value of the assets held by such Product, less such
                Product’s expenses and other liabilities, and the shares of such Product, if traded on any secondary market,
                may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the assets held by such
                Product, less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities, and such Product may be unable to meet its
                investment objective.

                The shares of each Product are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), the
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (except for Products that are SEC reporting companies), the Investment
                Company Act of 1940, or any state securities laws. The Products are offered in private placements pursuant
                to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 506(b) under Regulation D of the Securities Act and are
                only available to accredited investors. As a result, the shares of each Product are restricted and subject
                to significant limitations on resales and transfers. Potential investors in any Product should carefully
                consider the long-term nature of an investment in that Product prior to making an investment decision.
